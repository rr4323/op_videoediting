To create a video where a cow is eating, add an image to the left corner, and then use this video as a background for another green screen video, you can use a video editing tool like **Kdenlive** (free and open-source) or **Adobe Premiere Pro** (paid). Here's a step-by-step guide for both options.

### Option 1: Using **Kdenlive** (Free, Open Source)

#### Steps:

1. **Install Kdenlive**:
   - Download and install Kdenlive from the [official website](https://kdenlive.org).

2. **Import the Cow Eating Video and Image**:
   - Open Kdenlive and create a new project.
   - Import the cow eating video and the image you want to overlay by dragging them into the **Project Bin**.

3. **Add the Cow Video to the Timeline**:
   - Drag the cow video to **Track 1** in the timeline.

4. **Add the Image to the Timeline**:
   - Drag the image to **Track 2** in the timeline (above the cow video).
   - Select the image clip, and go to the **Effects** tab on the right.
   - Search for the **Transform** effect, and apply it to the image clip.

5. **Resize and Position the Image**:
   - In the **Effect Stack** on the right side, adjust the **Transform** settings to resize and move the image to the left corner.
   - You can drag the image on the preview window to position it correctly.

6. **Export the Video with Cow Eating and Image**:
   - Once you are satisfied with the result, click on **Render** and export the video.

7. **Use the New Video as Background for Green Screen Video**:
   - Now import the new video (cow eating + image) as well as your green screen video.
   - Drag the green screen video to **Track 2** and the cow eating video to **Track 1**.

8. **Apply Chroma Key to Remove Green Background**:
   - Select the green screen video in **Track 2**.
   - Go to the **Effects** tab and search for **Chroma Key**.
   - Apply the **Chroma Key: Simple** effect to the green screen video.
   - Use the color picker to select the green area, and adjust the similarity/blend options to remove the green background and make your green screen video transparent.

9. **Export the Final Video**:
   - Once everything is set, export the final video.

### Summary of Steps:
1. **Import the cow eating video and image**.
2. **Overlay the image in the left corner**.
3. **Export the combined video**.
4. **Import this combined video and green screen video**.
5. **Apply chroma key to remove the green background**.
6. **Export the final result**.

Both methods will allow you to create the desired video where the cow is eating, with an image in the left corner, and use it as a background for a green screen video. If you're looking for free software, **Kdenlive** is a great option!

To merge two images into a single frame, you can use various tools like **GIMP** (free and open-source), **Photoshop** (paid), or online editors like **Photopea** (free). Below are steps using **GIMP** and **Photoshop** to combine two images into a single frame.

### Option 1: Using **GIMP** (Free, Open-Source)

#### Steps:

1. **Install GIMP**:
   - Download and install GIMP from [GIMP's official website](https://www.gimp.org).

2. **Open the First Image**:
   - Open GIMP and go to **File > Open** to load the first image.

3. **Add the Second Image as a New Layer**:
   - Go to **File > Open as Layers** and select the second image. This will place the second image on top of the first image as a new layer.

4. **Resize and Position the Images**:
   - To resize the second image, use the **Scale Tool** by pressing `Shift + T` or selecting it from the toolbox.
   - Click on the second image and drag the corners to adjust its size.
   - Use the **Move Tool** (shortcut `M`) to position the second image where you want it on the canvas.

5. **Blend or Adjust the Layers** (Optional):
   - If you want to adjust how the two images blend together, go to the **Layers** panel.
   - Change the **Opacity** of the second image or experiment with different **Layer Modes** (e.g., Multiply, Overlay) to see how they interact.

6. **Merge the Layers**:
   - Once you’re satisfied with the position and blending of the images, go to **Image > Flatten Image** to merge the layers into one.

7. **Export the Merged Image**:
   - Go to **File > Export As** and choose the format (e.g., JPG, PNG) to save the merged image.


### Summary of Steps:
1. Open the first image.
2. Import the second image as a layer.
3. Resize and position the second image on the canvas.
4. Adjust opacity or blending modes if needed.
5. Export the merged image.

By following these steps, you’ll successfully combine two images into a single frame using free or paid tools.

**Glaxnimate** is an open-source vector graphics animation program. It is ideal for creating vector animations, and it's compatible with formats like Lottie, SVG, and Synfig. It can also be used for basic video editing tasks, like background removal and trimming animations.

If you want to cut or edit a video using **Glaxnimate**, here's how you can proceed:

### Steps to Use Glaxnimate for Animation or Editing:

#### 1. **Install Glaxnimate**:
   - Download it from the [official Glaxnimate GitHub page](https://github.com/Glaxnimate/glaxnimate) or [its website](https://glaxnimate.mattbas.org).
   - Install the software on your system.

#### 2. **Open Glaxnimate and Load Your File**:
   - Open Glaxnimate and create a new project or load a video file or animation you wish to edit.
   - You can import image sequences, SVG, or Lottie files to use in your project.

#### 3. **Cut or Trim Animation/Video**:
   - **Time Bar Navigation**: The timeline at the bottom allows you to control the animation frames or cut parts of an animation.
   - **Trimming Animation**: Drag the keyframes and timeline sliders to adjust which parts of the video/animation you want to keep.

#### 4. **Add Other Elements**:
   - **Add Text/Images**: You can place additional elements like images or text layers into the animation by clicking the **Add Layer** button.
   - **Layering**: Use the layer panel to control which objects are in front of or behind others.
   - **Blending**: If you want to merge animations or background images, you can add them to separate layers and manipulate their positions.

#### 5. **Use Keyframes for Precise Animation**:
   - Set keyframes on the timeline for specific changes at different points in time.
   - Move the object, change its opacity, or scale it at each keyframe to animate it.

#### 6. **Export Your Edited Animation/Video**:
   - Once you're done editing, go to **File > Export**.
   - Choose from supported formats like **Lottie**, **SVG**, or **Video** (export as frames and compile into video later).
   
### Using Glaxnimate for Background Removal:
   - If you want to remove the background of an image/animation, you can do this by either masking the object in vector form or exporting the animation with transparency (if supported by the format).
   - You can also integrate your animation with other software like Blender to handle advanced video compositing.

---

### Summary:
**Glaxnimate** is great for creating vector animations and basic edits. Although it's not specifically designed for advanced video editing tasks like cutting, it's useful for handling animations that you want to overlay or mix into other projects.
